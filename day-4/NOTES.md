# Notes

Another `C++` day it is. As I have written this I just wrapped up the `C# .NET` interview, which I belive went well. Through my practice and studying, I have refound a love for `C#`. I will certainly be looking to make a project involved with it soon (this will most likely be the push to create the RoR multiplayer map as I have desired for a while).

## Initial Observations

1. > O(n) time complexity with a traditional loop

Adjacency list generation?
    - Still lots of memory access -> maybe less compute overall?
        (need to loop through adj) (Do not need to compute multiple times)

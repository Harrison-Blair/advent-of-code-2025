# Notes

I should probably make a `cargo.toml` file, but I will not, I wish to suffer (gain knowledge). Ideally this helps to make what cargo does (more than just a package-manager & build tool) painfully apparent (I'll have to do it manually). Also surely this makes getting external libraries a pain, which I do not want to use.

The above has been disregarded, cuz Cargo is cool, and makes this so much easier. And my logic is flawed, as in order to learn as much as possible about Rust I need to learn how to use Cargo.

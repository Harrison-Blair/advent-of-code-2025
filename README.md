# advent-of-code-2025
My [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2025 solutions repository. My first time participating.

**Language Breakdown**
| Language | Day #'s |
| -------- | ------- |
|   C++    | [1](day-1), [4](day-4), [5](day-5)|
|   C#     | [2](day-2), [3](day-3)|
|   Rust   | [6](day-6), [8](day-8), [9](day-9)|
|  Python  | [7](day-7)|

## Dev Notes
I've tried my best to vary the languages used throughout the event. My preliminary strategy is to vary languages day-by-day, opposed to part by part. This may change depending on the scope of the problem. I feel this is the best way to focus on the solution rather than on transcribing existing code between parts of a day.

I've also limited AI coding assistance for this, as that would defeat the purpose. I have self-restrcited AI assitance to commit comments, repository configurations if needed, and as a potential second pair of eyes after long coding sessions.

# advent-of-code-2025
My "Advent of Code" 2025 solutions repository. My first one!

## Notes
I've tried my best to vary the languages used throughout the event. My preliminary strategy is to vary languages day-by-day, opposed to part by part. This may change depending on the scope of the problem. I feel this is the best way to focus on the solution rather than on transcribing existing code between parts of a day.

I've also turned off any AI coding assistance for this, as that would (in my opinion) defeat the purpose. I have self-restrcited AI assitance to commit comments and repository configurations if needed.

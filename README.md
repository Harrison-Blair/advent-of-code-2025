# advent-of-code-2025
My [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2025 solutions repository. My first time participating.

## Dev Notes
I've tried my best to vary the languages used throughout the event. My preliminary strategy is to vary languages day-by-day, opposed to part by part. This may change depending on the scope of the problem. I feel this is the best way to focus on the solution rather than on transcribing existing code between parts of a day.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As of `day-2` I was invited to interview for a [C# .NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/dotnet/hello-world-tutorial/install) job, so until that interview I will be doing the challenges in that language to bolster my study plan. After the interview I will vary my language use.

I've also turned off any AI coding assistance for this, as that would (in my opinion) defeat the purpose. I have self-restrcited AI assitance to commit comments and repository configurations if needed.
